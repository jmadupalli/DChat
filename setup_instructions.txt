Rename example.env to .env, and provide values accordingly.

Use npm to install all the dependencies for the project ('npm install').

React client:

Use 'npm run dev' to start the react client.

Enter name, the wallet you want to login as, do the same for another wallet to act as a recipient.

A lot of user info is saved within the localStorage of the browser linked to wallet address. Test it out!

Implementation Details:
My initial idea was to have a separate backend, and just use blockchain to verify the integrity of the message.
Alas! With a team of one, that didn't seem feasible for a hackathon setting. So instead chose to only use blockchain without
any other backend, this is a pure dApp as of now. 
Messages are encrypted using asymmetric encryption based on ether key-pairs (a new set of keys for this dApp), public key is stored 
in the smart contract, private key in your browser's local storage.
Messages are encrypted using the recipients' public key retrieved from the smart contract, messages are sent and delivered over blockchain.
The react client listens on new message events to retrieve the message, fetchMessages() is implemented to fetch messages while offline.
